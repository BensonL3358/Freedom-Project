In the Software Engineering Program for 10th grade students, we learn how to code in html on a platform named Repl where we practice. The purpose of the Freedom Project is to learn new content on your own and to apply what we learn in class to our work. The purpose of writing blogs is to look back on what we did and how we can improve. The topic my project will be covering is Console Programming.
